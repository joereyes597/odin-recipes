# Completing Odin-Recipe Project

## The Odin-Recipe exercise where you had to create 3 recipes and practice adding ordered & unordered lists and include links to images

I am a new beginer to coding and this project was practice to use what I've learned so far to create 3 recipe web pages and have them linked together.
